# form_DecisionTree

A self-written Decision Tree Classifier that deduces information based on input data.
For example, I used this classifier to predict where respondents to a certain survey on political opinion live. The UI is user-friendly and designed to help find meaningful deductions easily.
No external library was used for this project.
